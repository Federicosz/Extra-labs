# Welcome to your Final Project!


## Project Description
In this project, you will pick a topic of your choosing and perform an end-to-end analysis using what you have learned. 

## Project Goals
* Ask interesting and thoughful questions and find the data to answer them.
* Focus on improving in areas that are hard for you or learning more about something with which you feel comfortable. 
* Apply the statistical and/or machine learning techniques we have learned.
* Create useful and clear graphs.
* Present your insights in a thoughtful, clear and accurate way.

## Requirements
* You must plan your project. That is why creating a Kanban or Trello Board will help.
* You can include ML or statistics, but it is not required to do so, as long as you have a rigorous analysis.
* You may use the data from your last project or from past projects.

## Deliverables
* A well-commented notebook with your analysis.
* A 12 minute presentation (+8 minutes of questions)
* Repository with your workflow, documentation, and code. 
* The database where you have kept your data.  

## Tips & Tricks
* Organize yourself (don't get lost!). 
* Respect deadlines.
* Ask for help but remember: Google is your friend!
* Define a simple approach first. You never know how the data can betray you ðŸ˜‰.
* Document yourself. Learn about the problem and what research has been done before.
* Before making a graph, think about what you want it to represent.
* Don't force yourself to use techniques if they are not helpful for your objective.
* If using machine learning, remember:
  * This is an iterative process. Try your best to improve your model performance by:
    * Trying different models and select one that is the simplest yet produces the best results. Make sure you know what metric you are using you are defining 'best' and why!
    * Trying different hyperparameters and see if they improve the result.
